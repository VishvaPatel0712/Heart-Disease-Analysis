# Heart Disease Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset related to heart disease, using Python and popular data science libraries. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling steps to uncover insights and build predictive models for heart disease.

## Overview

The primary goals of this project include:
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and trends.
- Visualizing correlations and distributions to gain insights into heart disease factors.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features

1. **Data Exploration**: Detailed inspection of the dataset, including missing values and feature distributions.
2. **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps, pair plots, and bar charts to visualize relationships.
3. **Machine Learning**: Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict heart disease risk.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains medical records and features related to heart disease. Some key features include:
- Age
- Gender
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate

Ensure you have the dataset in the same directory as the notebook or modify the file path in the code.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-analysis
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `heart-disease-analysis.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the most critical factors influencing heart disease and evaluates the performance of predictive models. The results include visualizations and model performance metrics.
